## Recipe Box

This is a refreshed version of a project that I built a while ago. It's still in development, but here are some features that I will be creating:

- [ ] A user profile to view created recipes, favorited recipes, and followers
- [ ] A dashboard for users to manage their personal information and view messages
- [ ] Follow and favorite system
- [ ] Rating and commenting system
- [ ] Ability to create and edit recipes, including image (and possibly video) uploads
